## Game Play

The goal of this game is to use each number only once during the game and not run out of number options.

Each turn, you get a random number of stars. Select the number or numbers that add up to that number of stars, then click the equal sign. If you chose correctly, the button will turn green, and you can click it again to submit. You can deselect numbers by clicking on them (in the top right box).

If you have no options left for achieving the sum of the number of stars, you can click the orange redraw button for a new random number of stars. Be careful though! You only get 5 redraws per game. **Good luck!**
